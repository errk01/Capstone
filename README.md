## Project Description
   My capstone project will be a stock market watch web application. This web app will allow users to add the stocks they have invested or thinking about investing into a list. They will be able to create a list to view, add and remove items from the list. Users will have the ability to view the progress of the stocks. With this web application, users will also be updated in real time.

## What problem does your project solve?

  Instead of the user logging into your main investment application/ website to view or check your stocks, this will allow you easy access to view their investments. Without risking your personal information.
## Who has this problem?
    Anyone who has invested in stocks and bitcoin and does not like logging in to the main site to check progress.

## How will your project solve this problem?
    Allow users to see real-time data without risking their personal information. This will also have the ability to search for a new investment opportunity.

## What inputs does it need?
    The user will be able to register and log in create a list of stocks, with the function to add, remove and delete.

## What outputs does it produce?
    The ability to view, remove and edit and update their list.

## What technologies do you plan to use?
    Vue and Vuex, Vue-router, node, postico, postgresSql with JWT.
